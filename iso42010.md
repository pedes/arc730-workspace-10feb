4. Architectural Viewpoints and Views
4.1 Overview of Selected Viewpoints

The architecture is described through the following viewpoints:

    Logical View: Shows system components and their relationships.
    Process View: Describes dynamic behavior, including user interaction sequences.
    Physical View: Illustrates deployment on hardware/infrastructure.
    Development View: Maps out the organization of the source code and modules.
    Scenarios/Use Cases: Provides concrete examples of system usage.

4.2 Logical View

Purpose:
To depict the primary components (e.g., User Interface, Business Logic, Data Access) and their interactions.

Model:
A simplified UML component diagram (represented textually):

[User Interface]
      |
      v
[Business Logic] ---> [Payment Processing Service]
      |                     |
      v                     v
[Data Access Layer] ---> [Database Server]

Description:

    User Interface: Handles customer interactions.
    Business Logic: Processes orders and enforces business rules.
    Payment Processing Service: Integrates with external payment gateways.
    Data Access Layer: Manages persistent storage operations.

4.3 Process (Behavioral) View

Purpose:
To capture the dynamic behavior of the system during a typical user session (e.g., placing an order).

Model:
A sequence diagram (described textually):

    User: Initiates an order via the web interface.
    UI: Forwards the request to the Business Logic.
    Business Logic: Validates the order, interacts with Payment Processing.
    Payment Processing: Contacts the external payment gateway.
    Business Logic: Updates the Data Access Layer.
    UI: Displays confirmation to the User.

4.4 Physical (Deployment) View

Purpose:
To show how software components are deployed onto hardware/infrastructure.

Model:
A deployment diagram in textual form:

[Load Balancer]
       |
  -----------------
  |       |       |
[Web Server][Web Server][Web Server]
       |
[Application Server Cluster]
       |
[Database Cluster]

Description:

    Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic.
    Web Servers: Host the UI components.
    Application Servers: Run the business logic.
    Database Cluster: Stores transactional and customer data.

4.5 Development (Implementation) View

Purpose:
To illustrate the organization of the software components and modules for the development team.

Model:
A simplified component/package diagram:

[OnlineRetail.Platform]
   ├── [UI Module]
   ├── [Order Processing Module]
   ├── [Payment Integration Module]
   └── [Data Management Module]

Description:
Each module encapsulates related functionality, supports separation of concerns, and aids in parallel development.
4.6 Scenarios / Use Cases

Example Scenario – Placing an Order:

    Trigger: A customer selects products and initiates checkout.
    Sequence: The UI captures details, the Order Processing Module validates inputs, and the Payment Integration Module processes the payment.
    Outcome: The order is stored via the Data Management Module, and confirmation is sent to the customer.

5. Architectural Models and Correspondences
5.1 Overview of Architectural Models

The document uses multiple models:

    UML Component Diagram for the Logical View.
    Sequence Diagram for the Process View.
    Deployment Diagram for the Physical View.
    Package Diagram for the Development View.

5.2 Correspondences Between Views

    Logical and Process Views: The components defined in the Logical View are the actors in the Process View’s sequence.
    Development View: Reflects the modularity and separation of concerns seen in the Logical View.
    Physical View: Maps the components from the Logical and Development Views onto the target infrastructure.

5.3 Architectural Decisions Log

Final Remarks

This sample document follows the structure suggested by ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 by:

    Clearly stating the purpose and scope.
    Identifying stakeholders and mapping their concerns to specific architectural viewpoints.
    Presenting multiple architectural views (logical, process, physical, and development) to address those concerns.
    Documenting the architectural decisions, quality attributes, and risk mitigation strategies.

You can adapt this outline and sample to your own system by updating the models, diagrams, and decision logs as needed. This approach ensures that your architecture description is both comprehensive and aligned with industry standards.
